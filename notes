Stage 1
1. Namespace the metric names and add this to the spec
2. Add "operator_parent" and "operator_index" fields to the schema
3. Remove SQL from metadata - client must retain the query
4. New compute categories for window, distinct, limit, union. Make clear in spec this is up to the implementation to decide what belongs in each category.
5. Make clear this is not specific to FlightSQL - it is specific to Arrow Flight although its natural to pair with FlightSQL 
6. Clients dont need to ugnore unknown metric names, in fact thats almost the opposite of whats desired.  As long as they are assigned to a group it should be okay to display them.



3. Add validation step on the client that received metrics are compliant with 1
4. Check how units are provided - should be up to the implementation
5. New categories "index", "distributed" in metrics namespace
8. Decide on 0 or null for operators without metrics
10. streaming...
12. Partition Skew to compute analysis
14. Config options / resources - in metadata?
15. "analyze_query_capabilities" action for listing metrics / operators
16. "analyze_query_live" stream stats
17. Standardize units

Done
6. New compute categories window, distinct, limit, union
7. Ambiguous compute categories are up to the implementation to decide
13. Add "operator_parent" and "operator_index"
9. No SQL in metadata, client is expected to retain this
11. Make clear this is not specific to FlightSQL - it is specific to Arrow Flight although its natural to pair with FlightSQL 
2. Clients dont need to ugnore unknown metric names, in fact thats almost the opposite of whats desired.  As long as they are assigned to a group it should be okay to display them.  Optionally, there can config to determine if unknown metrics throw error or are included
